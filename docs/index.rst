==========================================

ShotgunUnifrac is a snakemake pipeline for generating a phylogeny per core gene over a selection of genomes and then combining them together to create a consensus phylogeny. The pipeline is written in snakemake and includes a python library for data curation and prep. View the :ref:`quickstart` page to see a worked example of installing and using the pipeline.
